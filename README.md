Have you ever faced any problem where you have to work with a different language and you cannot copy-paste the text into Google translator?
Well, Here is a solution. This project helps you to translate text that you cannot select or copy.

The idea is simple. Capture the text, get the text using OCR, and translate it!

I have used <a href="https://ocr.space/ocrapi">ocr.space</a> for OCR purpose as it has free API which is failry very good at extracting text but you can use  <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract-ocr</a>. 
The application has been built on the JavaFX platform. You can try the application by running the jar file. Download the .jar file <a href="https://github.com/tuski/ClickTrans/raw/master/bin/ClickTrans-1.0.jar">here</a>

The app is very easy to use. Just run the app select the area you want to translate and <b>Press C</b>.
That's it.
