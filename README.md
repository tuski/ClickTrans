I have used <a href="https://ocr.space/ocrapi">ocr.space</a> for OCR purpose as it has free API which is failry very good at extracting text but you can use  <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract-ocr</a>. 
The application has been built on the JavaFX platform. You can try the application by running the jar file. Download the .jar file <a href="https://github.com/tuski/ClickTrans/raw/master/bin/ClickTrans-1.0.jar">here</a>
